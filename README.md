# emacs_highlight
I copied highlight-symbol code from Nikolaj Schumacher and then write some simple functions to build my plugin. Feel free to use or update it in any way you want.

To use the plugin, just download the two files, and point to the file path like below



(load "TYPE_FULL_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_FILES/high_light_words")



Double click will highlight the word, double clicking again will unhighlight the word again.
Each time it will use a different color to highlight the words.

alt+r  will remove all the highlights



ctrl+n  will goto next highlight



ctrl+p  will goto previous highlight
